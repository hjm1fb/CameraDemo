# CameraDemo
Android Camera Demo.
Now it has one Activity that shows "How to Use GLSurfaceView to Preview Camera Frame Data"
It also shows:
1. How to Flip the View 
2. How to Capture the GLsurfaceView Screen 

This Demo is simple, some encapsulation should been done if you want to use code in this demo to build your production app. for example, 'cameraViewContainer' in the 'CameraGLSurfaceActivity' now is just FrameLayout, you could make it a custom view like real 'CameraViewContainer' and remove method like 'resizeSurfaceView' there.

[An article in Chinese](https://www.jianshu.com/p/c3ebb965bce6) will be written in the future to illustrate more about this Demo, stay tuned!
